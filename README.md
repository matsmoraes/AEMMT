## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance **Evolutionary Algorithm (AMMT)** in **C++** designed to solve the **Multi-Objective Knapsack Problem (MOKP)**.

In combinatorial optimization, the MOKP is a classic problem where items have a specific weight and multiple conflicting profit values. The goal is to select a subset of items to maximize multiple objectives simultaneously without exceeding the capacity of the knapsack.

This repository contains:
1.  **C++ Solver:** A genetic algorithm engine optimized for performance, capable of handling large instances (up to 1000 items).
2.  **Python Analytics Pipeline:** Scripts to visualize convergence and calculate the **Hypervolume** metric using `pymoo`, comparing the results against state-of-the-art algorithms like **NSGA-III**.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Requirements

To replicate the experiments and run the visualization scripts, you need the following environment:

### 1. C++ Compiler

* **GCC/G++** (Supporting C++11 standard or higher).
* *Windows users:* MinGW or Visual Studio Build Tools.
* *Linux/Mac users:* Standard `build-essential`.

### 2. Python Environment

The analysis scripts rely on Python 3.x and specific data science libraries. You can install all dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy pymoo

```

* **pandas & numpy:** For data manipulation and vector operations.
* **matplotlib & seaborn:** For generating high-quality scientific plots.
* **pymoo:** A specific framework for Multi-Objective Optimization, used here to calculate the Hypervolume indicator.

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Metrics

### The Repair Heuristic

A critical component of this solver (`evaluate_and_repair` function in `main.cpp`) is its ability to handle constraints. Instead of simply discarding invalid solutions (chromosomes that exceed knapsack weight), the algorithm applies a **Greedy Repair Heuristic**:

1. It identifies items in the knapsack.
2. It calculates a ratio (Profit/Weight) for the selected items.
3. It iteratively removes the items with the *worst* efficiency ratios until the weight constraint is met.
This approach significantly accelerates convergence by guiding the population toward feasible regions of the search space.

### Why Hypervolume?

In Multi-Objective Optimization, there is rarely a single "best" solution. Instead, we seek a set of trade-off solutions known as the **Pareto Front**.

To evaluate the quality of our approximation, we use the **Hypervolume (HV)** metric:

* **Definition:** HV measures the volume of the objective space that is "dominated" by the solution set relative to a reference point.
* **Significance:** It is one of the few unary metrics that captures both **Convergence** (how close we are to the true optimum) and **Diversity** (how well spread our solutions are across the objectives).
* **In this project:** The `plot_final_cpp.py` script calculates the normalized HV to prove that the AMMT algorithm produces results competitive with (or superior to) NSGA-III.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### Step 1: Compile and Run the C++ Solver

First, compile the core logic to generate the raw data (`fronteira_pareto_completa.csv` and `evolucao_fitness.csv`).

```bash
# Compile with optimization flag -O3
g++ main.cpp -o benchmark_app -O3

# Run the executable
./benchmark_app

```

### Step 2: Visualizing Convergence

Generate the plot that shows how the algorithm improves over generations.

```bash
python plot_convergence.py

```

*Output: `analise_convergencia.png*`

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis (Hypervolume)

Run the final comparison script to calculate metrics and compare against literature data.

```bash
python plot_final_cpp.py

```

*Output: `comparacao_final_hv_roleta.png*`

## 📊 Results

The output images generated by the pipeline provide two main insights:

1. **Convergence Analysis:** Demonstrates the stability of the genetic algorithm, showing a steady increase in fitness across generations for different problem sizes (250, 500, 750, 1000 items).
2. **Algorithm Comparison:** The bar charts compare the **Mean Hypervolume** of the AMMT approach against the **NSGA-III** (based on data extracted from scientific literature). This validates the efficiency of the implemented Selection and Crossover operators.
